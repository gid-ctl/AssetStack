# Contributing to Asset Tokenization Protocol

We love your input! We want to make contributing to the Asset Tokenization Protocol as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Pull Requests Process

1. Fork the repo and create your branch
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code lints
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

When you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](LICENSE) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issue tracker]

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue]().

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Development Process

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a new branch for your feature/fix
3. Write tests for your changes
4. Implement your changes
5. Run the test suite
6. Submit a Pull Request

## Testing

We use Clarinet for testing. To run tests:

```bash
clarinet test
```
