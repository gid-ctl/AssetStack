# Asset Tokenization Protocol

A robust smart contract implementation for tokenizing real-world assets with fractional ownership capabilities, built on the Stacks blockchain.

## Overview

The Asset Tokenization Protocol enables the creation and management of tokenized real-world assets with features including:

- Asset creation with configurable supply and metadata
- Fractional ownership management
- Built-in compliance checks
- Secure ownership transfers
- Administrative controls
- Comprehensive event logging

## Features

- **Asset Creation**: Create new tokenized assets with customizable total supply and fractional shares
- **Fractional Ownership**: Enable partial ownership of assets through divisible shares
- **Compliance Management**: Built-in compliance checks and status management
- **Secure Transfers**: Protected ownership transfer mechanisms with validation
- **Event Tracking**: Comprehensive event logging for all major operations
- **Administrative Controls**: Secure admin functions for compliance management

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Clarinet](https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet) for local development
- [Stacks Wallet](https://www.hiro.so/wallet) for contract interaction
- Basic understanding of Clarity smart contracts

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gid-ctl/AssetStack.git
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
clarinet requirements
```

3. Run tests:

```bash
clarinet test
```

### Usage

#### Creating a New Asset

```clarity
(contract-call? .asset-tokenization-protocol create-asset
    u1000000 ;; total supply
    u1000    ;; fractional shares
    "https://metadata.example.com/asset/1" ;; metadata URI
)
```

#### Transferring Shares

```clarity
(contract-call? .asset-tokenization-protocol transfer-fractional-ownership
    u1        ;; asset-id
    tx-sender ;; to-principal
    u100      ;; amount
)
```

#### Checking Compliance Status

```clarity
(contract-call? .asset-tokenization-protocol get-compliance-details
    u1        ;; asset-id
    tx-sender ;; user
)
```

## Architecture

The protocol is built on several key components:

1. **Asset Registry**: Stores core asset information and configuration
2. **Share Management**: Handles fractional ownership accounting
3. **Compliance System**: Manages user compliance status
4. **Event System**: Tracks all significant protocol actions
5. **NFT Layer**: Represents primary asset ownership

## Security

- Built-in authorization checks
- Comprehensive input validation
- Protected admin functions
- Event logging for audit trails
