# Technical Specification: Asset Tokenization Protocol

## Overview

The Asset Tokenization Protocol is a smart contract system designed to enable the tokenization of real-world assets with fractional ownership capabilities. This document outlines the technical architecture, components, and implementation details of the protocol.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Asset Registry**

   - Stores asset metadata and configuration
   - Tracks ownership and supply information
   - Manages transferability status

2. **Share Management System**

   - Handles fractional ownership accounting
   - Manages share transfers between parties
   - Tracks individual share balances

3. **Compliance System**

   - Manages user compliance status
   - Handles compliance checks for transfers
   - Stores compliance history

4. **Event System**
   - Logs all significant protocol actions
   - Maintains audit trail
   - Enables external system integration

### Data Structures

#### Asset Registry

```clarity
(define-map asset-registry
  {asset-id: uint}
  {
    owner: principal,
    total-supply: uint,
    fractional-shares: uint,
    metadata-uri: (string-utf8 256),
    is-transferable: bool,
    created-at: uint
  }
)
```

#### Share Ownership

```clarity
(define-map share-ownership
  {asset-id: uint, owner: principal}
  {shares: uint}
)
```

#### Compliance Status

```clarity
(define-map compliance-status
  {asset-id: uint, user: principal}
  {
    is-approved: bool,
    last-updated: uint,
    approved-by: principal
  }
)
```

## Core Functions

### Asset Creation

- Function: `create-asset`
- Parameters:
  - `total-supply`: Total number of shares
  - `fractional-shares`: Minimum divisible unit
  - `metadata-uri`: URI pointing to asset metadata
- Validation:
  - Supply must be greater than 0
  - Fractional shares must be less than or equal to total supply
  - Valid metadata URI format

### Share Transfer

- Function: `transfer-fractional-ownership`
- Parameters:
  - `asset-id`: Unique identifier of the asset
  - `to-principal`: Recipient address
  - `amount`: Number of shares to transfer
- Validation:
  - Valid asset ID
  - Sufficient balance
  - Compliance checks
  - Transferability status

### Compliance Management

- Function: `set-compliance-status`
- Parameters:
  - `asset-id`: Asset identifier
  - `user`: User address
  - `is-approved`: Compliance status
- Access Control:
  - Only contract owner
  - Valid asset and user validation

## Security Considerations

### Access Control

- Contract owner privileges
- Transfer restrictions
- Compliance requirements

### Input Validation

- Range checks
- Format validation
- Address validation

### Asset Protection

- Ownership verification
- Balance checks
- Transfer locks

## Error Handling

### Error Codes

- `ERR-UNAUTHORIZED`: Access control violation
- `ERR-INSUFFICIENT-FUNDS`: Insufficient balance
- `ERR-INVALID-ASSET`: Invalid asset reference
- `ERR-TRANSFER-FAILED`: Transfer operation failed
- `ERR-COMPLIANCE-CHECK-FAILED`: Failed compliance check
- `ERR-INVALID-INPUT`: Invalid input parameters
- `ERR-INSUFFICIENT-SHARES`: Insufficient share balance
- `ERR-EVENT-LOGGING`: Event logging failure

## Event System

### Event Types

- Asset Creation
- Share Transfer
- Compliance Update
- Administrative Actions

### Event Structure

```clarity
{
  event-type: (string-utf8 24),
  asset-id: uint,
  principal1: principal,
  timestamp: uint
}
```

## Performance Considerations

### Storage Optimization

- Minimal data storage
- Efficient data structures
- Optimized mapping access

### Gas Efficiency

- Minimized state changes
- Optimized loops and iterations
- Efficient validation checks

## Integration Guidelines

- Metadata management

### Client Integration

- API endpoints
- Event handling
- Error management

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

- Function-level testing
- Input validation
- Error handling

### Integration Tests

- End-to-end workflows
- Multi-step operations
- Edge cases

### Security Tests

- Access control
- Input validation
- Error handling
